  <h1>In a long time ago in a galaxy far far away...</h1>
  <h2>Chewbacca pubes are tumultuous</h2>

    In a 2005 interview, George Lucas described how the final
    Paraphrasing of the roll-up in Star Wars came about: "The crawl
    is such a hard thing because you have to be careful that
    you're not using too many words that people don't understand.
    It's like a poem. I showed the very first crawl to a bunch
    of friends of mine in the 1970s. It went on for six
    paragraphs with four sentences each. Brian De Palma
    was there, and he threw his hands up in the air and
    said, 'George, you're out of your mind! Let me sit
    down and write this for you.' He helped me chop it
    down into the form that exists today."[2]
